MiniSLATE Install

First install dependecies: Docker CE and Docker Compose

Docker CE on Ubuntu: https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/
Docker CE on CentOS: https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/centos/
Other operating systems are in the sidebar.

Docker Compose:
Use pip, install with your package manager.

Then: (sudo) pip install docker-compose

Inside the project directory run: ./minislate start

When the process is complete you can issue commands from the slate client in a new terminal:

./minislate slate ...(cluster list, vo list, etc)...

You can also just get a shell in the slate container with: ./minislate shell slate

To turn off the environment but not destroy it, run: ./minislate pause
Then turn it back on with: ./minislate resume

To completely destroy the environment such that it can be created again with start.sh, run: ./minislate purge

Note that this command does not remove the images that were built with the first run of `minislate start`.
It removes the containers and their volumes so any data added by you is destroyed.
Therefore, you will not need to wait for the build process to complete when running `minislate start` again.

To force a rebuild and pull the latest versions of the software run: ./minislate build

You may wish to create a node that can be joined to an existing cluster, this can be done by running `./minislate bare`.
You should then run `./minislate shell kube` and run the `kubeadm join` command here to join the node to the cluster.
